After finding that the multiplayer sockets werenâ€™t going to work with my project, I went for the single player aspect of the game. Instead of making the problem a multiplayer game, I made the AI be the problem I wanted to solve. I planned to use low level AIs for easy-to-beat wild Pokemon, and higher level, harder AI for the boss of the game. I also wanted to create a simple and fun game that required at least some strategy. I tried to implement this by creating Pokemon with strengths and weaknesses, so one would have to weigh the cost of battling with/against certain Pokemon.
